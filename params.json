{"name":"Scribe","tagline":"A Gmail extension that converts URLs to embedded images or to title text, like Quora's text editor. ","body":"# About\r\n\r\nScribe is a Chrome extension that replaces raw URLS in Gmail compose and reply windows to human-friendly hyperlinks and images automatically. Links become the title text of the page they point to; image URLs become the image they represent. These features were inspired by Quora's text editor.\r\n\r\nJust type in the raw URL, click outside the document, press F2, and wait.\r\n\r\n# Version \r\n\r\nScribe is at version **1.0**. \r\n\r\n# Things You Should Know\r\n\r\n* Scribe is _safe_. Images and links are embedded using a secure HTTPS middleman.\r\n* Scribe is _sensible_. It preserves formatting, works across all open reply and compose windows, and will turn a URL into a hyperlink if it can't find the image or page it can't find.\r\n* Scribe is _useful_. Why use Google Chrome's inbuilt editor, when you can do it at the press of a button?\r\n\r\nScribe's speed depends on your network connection.\r\n\r\n![A GIF that sows how to use it](http://www.akshatm.com/images/example.gif)\r\n\r\n# Things We Want to Fix\r\n\r\n* Right now, Scribe makes **synchronous** requests. That means you can't do anything else in Gmail until it finishes loading your images and hyperlinks. We don't like that behaviour any more than you do.\r\n\r\n* There's no obvious notification system / animation right now to let you know when we're turning your URLs into something pretty. We're working on this right now.\r\n\r\n# Want to help? Or leave an issue?\r\n\r\nSee [the Github repository](http://www.github.com/AkshatM/Scribe) for contributing. Issues are always welcome.
